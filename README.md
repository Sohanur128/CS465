# CS465
# Architecture
I used Express with Handlebars and JavaScript for the customer-facing pages. I used Angular for the admin side. Express and Handlebars created static pages and used server rendering. Angular created a single-page application for the admin side. The backend used a NoSQL MongoDB database. MongoDB let me store trip data as documents. This was flexible and worked well with JSON.

# Functionality
JSON is a format for storing and transporting data. JSON is different from JavaScript because it is text only. JSON tied the frontend and backend together through the API. It sent data to the frontend from the backend. I refactored my API endpoints to clean up code. I moved logic into controllers. I used Angular components to make reusable UI parts. This helped me keep my code organized and easy to update.

# Testing
I used Postman to test API endpoints. I tested GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods. I checked if my endpoints returned the correct JSON and status codes. I added CORS to allow Angular to call the API. I added security for admin login. I tested login to make sure only authorized users could add or edit trips. I checked the browser console for errors during testing.

# Reflection
This course helped me learn full stack development. I learned to build a working web application. I learned to use Express, MongoDB, and Angular. I learned to test APIs and use JSON to connect the backend and frontend. I learned to use Git and GitHub. I now know how to create and deploy a full stack app. It will help me in my career and make me a better candidate.
